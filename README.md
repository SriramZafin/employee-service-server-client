# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the 
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a client stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled scala client.

This example uses scala to generate the client stubs -

To generate the client side stub :

1. Make sure the swagger specification is available at https://appname/api-docs/swagger.json
2. Download the swagger-codegen available at https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen
3. Build the project using "mvn package"
4. From this project location. generate the client stubs using the below command
 java -jar modules/swagger-codegen-cli/target/swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate -i https://appname/api-docs/swagger.json -l scala -o ../scala-employee-service-client

 where -l denotes the language for the client stub generation 
    -o denotes the output folder where the server stubs get generated
